This project is based on the CUDA implementation of Conways's game of life.
You can follow the Report to understand the concept and the implementation along with the results.

CUDA_data contains the data of several iterations of GOL 
CUDA_GOL.ipynb contains the actual code

In later version, I will improve upon the animation to have a proper interface with smoother transitions.

Below is the animation that I have captured.
